# Crop yield prediction using gradient boosting and geospatial data

This is my crop yield prediction project repository. It contains all the necessary information to reproduce the results of my **[paper](./paper.pdf)** on the subject as well as the explanation of the key techniques, ideas and results.

**The main** idea behine the research is to develop a gradient boosting model that would give yearly yield predictions for corn and soybean crops in 13 states of interest using geospatial data. The data was collected using Google Earth Enigne service as well as USDA statistical database and later transformed to tabular format so as to apply classical machine learning techniques.
